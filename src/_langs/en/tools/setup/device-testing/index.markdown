One way or another you will need to try your site on various platforms,
spanning a number of device form factors.

There are a few different ways that you can view your site on different devices.
The one thing you need to keep in mind at all times is that nothing replaces
the real thing.

Simulators and emulators display content like the real device would; they are great for
exploring layouts locally, but they are often much faster (or slower) and they wonâ€™t
always have the same behavior as a real device.
