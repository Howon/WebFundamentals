Page exceptions and JavaScript errors are actually quite useful -- if you can get to the details behind them. When a page throws an exception or a script produces an error, the Console provides specific, reliable information to help you locate and correct the problem. In the Console you can track exceptions and trace the execution path that led to them, explicitly or implicitly catch them (or ignore them), and even set error handlers to automatically collect and process exception data.
