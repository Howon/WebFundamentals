## Measure execution times

### Measuring how long something takes

A timer starts by calling the [`time()`](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-api#consoletimelabel) method. You must pass a string to the method to identify the time marker.
When you want to end the measurement call [`timeEnd()`](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-api#consoletimeendlabel) and pass it the same string passed to the initializer.
The console logs the label and time elapsed when the `timeEnd()` method fires.

Example code and output for timing JavaScript execution:

    console.time("Array initialize");
    var array= new Array(1000000);
    for (var i = array.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        array[i] = new Object();
    };
    console.timeEnd("Array initialize");

Output in the console:

When a [Timeline](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/timeline) recording is taking place during a `time()` operation, it annotates the timeline as well.
This is useful when tracing what your application does and where it comes from.

How an annotation on the timeline looks from `time()`:

### Marking the Timeline

The [Timeline panel](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/timeline) provides a complete overview of where the engine spends time.
You can add a mark to the timeline from the console with the [`timeStamp()`](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-api#consoletimestamplabel). This is a simple way to correlate events in your application with other events.

Note: The `timeStamp()` method only functions while a Timeline recording is in progress.

The `timeStamp()` annotates the Timeline in the following places:

- A yellow vertical line in the Timeline's summary and details view.
- It adds a record to the list of events.

Example code:

    function AddResult(name, result) {
        console.timeStamp("Adding result");
        var text = name + ': ' + result;
        var results = document.getElementById("results");
        results.innerHTML += (text + "<br>");
    }

Timestamps in the timeline:

## Counting statement executions

The `count()` method logs the provided string along with the number of times the same string has been provided.
The string may have dynamic content.
When the exact statement is given to `count()` on the same line, the number is incremented.

Example code of using `count()` with some dynamic content:

    function login(user) {
        console.count("Login called for user " + user);
    }

    users = [ // by last name since we have too many Pauls.
        'Irish',
        'Bakaus',
        'Kinlan'
    ];

    users.forEach(function(element, index, array) {
        login(element);
    });

    login(users[0]);
