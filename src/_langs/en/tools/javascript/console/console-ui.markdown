### Opening the Console

The console is accessible either from the dedicated Chrome DevTools 'Console' panel, or from a Drawer which can be opened from within any of the other panels for quick access.


#### The Console Panel

To open the dedicated 'Console' panel, either:

* Use the keyboard shortcuts
  * On Windows and Linux: <kbd class="kbd">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">Shift</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">J</kbd>
  * On Mac: <kbd class="kbd">Cmd</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">Option</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">J</kbd>
* Select the Chrome Menu icon <img src="images/menu.gif" alt="menu" style="display:inline-block;margin:0;width:15px" /> > More Tools > JavaScript Console.
* Or if the Chrome Developer Tools are already open, press the 'Console' tab.

#### The Console Drawer

To open the drawer from within another panel, either:

* Press the <kbd class="kbd">Esc</kbd> key when the Chrome DevTools are in focus.
* Or click the 'Show Drawer' icon <img src="images/drawer.gif" alt="drawer" style="display:inline-block;margin:0;width:15px" /> found in the upper right corner of the Chrome DevTools.

### Message Stacking

The console keeps a record of every message and interaction made on any given page until the page is closed, navigated away from, or refreshed. If the same message is repeated consecutive times, the console stacks them to keep the information provided as concise as possible. When messages are stacked, the number in the left margin shows how many times a particular message has been repeated.

For example, the following code outputs the message 'Hello There' for numbers not divisible by 5 without a remainder, causing console message stacking:

		for (i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
			if (i % 5 === 0) {
				console.log('Hello World');
			} else {
				console.log('Hello There');
			}
		}

To keep Console messages unstacked, enable 'Show timestamps' from the 'Settings' menu  <img src="images/settings.gif" alt="settings" style="display:inline-block;margin:0;width:15px" /> found in the upper right corner to give every message a unique timestamp.

### Clearing the Console History

The console history can be cleared by doing any of the following:

* Right-click or Ctrl-click anywhere in the Console area and choose 'Clear Console' from the context menu that appears.
* Enter the `clear()` Command Line API at the shell prompt.
* Invoke `console.clear()` Console API from within your JavaScript code.
* Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd class="kbd">Cmd</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">K</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd class="kbd">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">L</kbd> (Windows and Linux).

### Persisting the Console History

The console history can be persisted during page refreshes and when navigating between pages by selecting the 'Preserve log' option found at the top of the console. Messages will be stored until the console is cleared or until the tab is closed.

### Saving the Console History

Right-click or Ctrl-click anywhere in the console area and choose 'Save As' to save the output of the console to a log file that can be opened in any text editor.

### Frame Selection

By default logging and error output from frames contained within a page will not be output to the Console. Multiple frames on a single page can be accessed individually from the Chrome DevTools by using the dropdown at the top of the console. An iframe element, for example, would create its own frame context, selectable from this menu.

### Filtering the Console Output

For more information on filtering see [Organizing Console Output](https://web-central.appspot.com/web/tools/javascript/console/console-write?hl=en)

### Settings

There are a number of other Console customization options available from the 'Settings' menu <img src="images/settings.gif" alt="settings" style="display:inline-block;margin:0;width:15px" /> under the 'Console' heading.

#### Hide network messages

By default, the console reports network issues. Turning this on instructs the console to not show logs from these errors. For example, 404 and 500 series errors will not be logged.

#### Log XMLHttpRequests

Determines if the console logs each XMLHttpRequest.

#### Preserve log upon navigation

Persists the console history during page refreshes or navigation.

#### Show timestamps

Prepends a timestamp to each console message showing when the call was made. Useful for debugging when a certain event occurred. This will disable message stacking.
