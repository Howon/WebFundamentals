When you're reading this, you're probably already close to our new home at http://developers.google.com/web, Google's new one-stop destination for everything web-related.

Naturally, DevTools and the rest of the tooling gang had to join the party so we've moved our main homepage – along with all documentation – over to http://developers.google.com/web/chrome-devtools. But don't let the new shiny fool you: We have plenty of content additions and more substantial changes for you.

## Goal-oriented tutorials

We've moved all of DevTools' documentation over to the new site, but we didn't stop there. All of our in-depth tutorials that show you how to use DevTools are now goal- or action-oriented, similar to how [Web Fundamentals](http://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals) structures its pages. So instead of "Learn everything about the network panel", you'll get "Optimize your network performance".

Going forward, our tutorials and guides will tell an overarching tooling story independent of any specific tool. Tutorials from the old Tools section in Web Fundamentals have already been moved over and we'll work on adding more non-DevTools related content in the future to give you a full picture of developer productivity.

Head over to the [Setup section](/web/tools/setup/) to get started.

## Updates, news and useful tips

Inspired by the fantastic [devtoolstips.com](http://devtoolstips.com/) and [Umar's on Twitter](https://twitter.com/umaar), and with the help and support of Umar, we've launched a new [updates section](/web/updates/tools) that features the latest DevTools news, extensions and useful advice.

We, the DevTools team, will still do occasional blogs on the [Chromium blog](http://blog.chromium.org/), but they'll be abbreviated and link out to our very own blog here.

Let us know what you think and come by often!
